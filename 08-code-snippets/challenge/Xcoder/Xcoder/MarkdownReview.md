### Markdown - easy to read, write and edit

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. **- Wikipedia**

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

}
```
